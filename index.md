# Finance Conference Deadlines

This is a simple public listing of submission deadlines for academic or research-oriented finance conferences.

The list is in no way comprehensive. The American Finance Association also maintains a [calendar](https://afajof.org/call-for-papers-calendar/).

If you would like a conference added to the list, please open an [issue](https://github.com/tbeason/financeconferences/issues).

I keep a list of past conference deadlines available for download [here](/data/conferences_pastdue.csv).
